# React Movie Database
In this project I built Movie Search App in React.

I used [The Movie Database API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction)

> Actually. I did not like the response. It does not have so many options, but finding a free Api without any limits seems hard.

## Technologies that I used
- React useState(in future with useReducer probably do not need those ones)
- ContextApi
- React-router-dom
- axios
- Tailwindcss
